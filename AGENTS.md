# AGENTS.md â€”Â Guidance for Autonomous Coding Agents

Welcome, silicon colleague!Â This repository welcomes **agentic AI coding tools** so long as they operate transparently, deterministically, and **never leave the tree in a broken state**.Â The rules below tell you how to propose, implement, and validate changes.

> **Scope**â€ƒThese guidelines apply to any nonâ€‘human contributor that opens a pullâ€‘request or pushes commits, whether that agent is ChatGPTâ€‘based, GitHubÂ Copilotâ€‘based, or homeâ€‘grown.

## 1. Golden Rules

| Â # | Â Rule                                                                                                                  | Â Why it matters                       |
| -- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Â 1 | **Leave the branch buildâ€‘green.** Running `make lint build` **must** finish without error or warnings.                 | Humans trust CI to catch regressions. |
| Â 2 | **No orphan artefacts.** Update docs and manifests when you add/rename/remove files.                                   | Prevents drift between code and docs. |
| Â 3 | **Respect the licence.** All thirdâ€‘party assets must be CC0/CCâ€‘BY and include attribution in `README.md` or `CREDITS`. | Legal peace of mind.                  |
| Â 4 | **Small, atomic commits** with ConventionalÂ Commit prefixes (feat, fix, ci, docs, chore, refactor, style, perf).       | Easier reviews and revertability.     |
| Â 5 | **Explain yourself in plain English** in PRs (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` is provided; fill it).                | Human maintainers need context.       |
| Â 6 | **Never discard user data.** Storage keys under `timers` must migrate, not reset.                                      | Data integrity for live users.        |

## 2. Directory Map

```text
manifest.json            # WebExtension manifest (MV3)
background.js            # Serviceâ€‘worker code
contentScript.js         # Injected into each tab
popup.{html,js,css}      # UI
icons/                   # CC0/CCâ€‘BY art (48Â &Â 96Â png)
LICENSE                  # ISC
README.md, Makefile      # Dev docs & tasks
AGENTS.md                # <- you are here
```

Any new topâ€‘level file or directory **must** be documented in the list above.

## 3. What You May Change

| Area                 | Permitted Actions                                                       | Guardâ€‘rails                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Background logic** | Optimise timer handling, add features (e.g. custom snooze, badge text). | Must keep MV3 worker constraints (no longâ€‘lived globals).                     |
| **Popup UI**         | Improve UX, localisation, accessibility.                                | Never exceed 150Â kB uncompressed JS per Google/AMO guideline.                 |
| **Build tooling**    | Extend `Makefile`, add GitHubÂ Actions.                                  | All automation must be optional for local dev (no required proprietary SaaS). |
| **Docs**             | Expand tutorials, update screenshots.                                   | Use Oxford English spelling.                                                  |
| **Assets**           | Replace icons with higherâ€‘resolution or different style.                | Must satisfy RuleÂ 3 (licence) and update manifest/icon paths.                 |

## 4. Validation Checklist

Before committing, an agent **MUST** run the following and parse exit codes:

```bash
# 1. Static analysis
make lint          # => 0 exit status

# 2. Build artefact
make build         # creates dist/*.xpi; ensure file exists and nonâ€‘empty

# 3. Runtime smoke test (optional but preferred)
web-ext run -t chromium --no-input --quit-after-install 3  # closes after 3 s
```

If any step failsÂ â†’ abort the commit or PR and report diagnostics.

---

## 5. Semantic Versioning

Agents should bump `manifest.json > version` following **SemVer**:

* **MAJOR**Â â€“ backwardsâ€‘incompatible change (rare).
* **MINOR**Â â€“ new functionality, backwardsâ€‘compatible.
* **PATCH**Â â€“ bugâ€‘fixes, docs, internal refactor.

`Makefile` parses the field via `jq`; keep it numeric (x.y.z).

---

## 6. Pullâ€‘Request Expectations

A valid PR raised by an agent must:

1. **Reference an Issue** or state the motivation in the description.
2. Include **Before/After screenshots or GIFs** for UI changes.
3. Quote any **external sources** used for code or assets.
4. Pass the full **CI matrix** (Linux & macOS, latest ESR & Nightly).

---

## 7. Unsafe Actions (Just Donâ€™t)

* Forceâ€‘pushing to *main*.
* Rewriting human commit history.
* Committing credentials or embedding telemetry without consent.
* Executing network calls in build scripts.

Violation âžœ automatic CI rejection, human maintainer review required.

## 8. Metaâ€‘Guidelines for Large Language Model Agents

1. **Chainâ€‘ofâ€‘Thought Isolation** â€“ Do not commit your private reasoning; only final code and concise explanations.
2. **Temperature â‰¤Â 0.3** â€“ favour determinism to keep diffs reproducible.
3. **Citation** â€“ When code is derived from docs/StackOverflow, add a source comment with URL and licence.
4. **DiffÂ Awareness** â€“ Generate *minimal* patches; prefer `sed`â€‘style replacements over fullâ€‘file rewrites unless necessary.

## 9. Contact

For clarifications ping **@leynos** or open an **Issue: question**. Humans are friendly but protective of their tabs. ðŸ˜„

Happy hacking, mechanical friend! Keep the bells ringing on time.
